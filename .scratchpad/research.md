# Research: AI Mode v2 (Telemetry + Context Memory + Progress UX)

## User Request (new)
1. Confirm whether Open WebUI is currently supported.
2. For all requests sent to AI, store model/request metrics in DB.
3. Use metrics to predict request duration; if expected duration > 5s, show progress indicator and remove it after response.
4. Improve direct AI mode quality for weaker models (30b/70b/120b):
   - richer dialog context,
   - first answer must be concise,
   - ask clarifying question when input is ambiguous.
5. On re-entering AI mode, ask user to restore previous context or start a new dialog.
6. Persist/reload context from DB and compress memory due limited context window.

## Codebase Findings
- Open WebUI support exists and is production-wired:
  - `shared/ai_providers.py` contains `OpenWebUIProvider`.
  - Provider registration key: `open_webui`.
  - Env vars: `OPEN_WEBUI_BASE_URL`, `OPEN_WEBUI_API_KEY`, `OPEN_WEBUI_MODEL`.
  - Covered by `tests/test_ai_providers.py`.
- Direct AI mode is implemented in `frontend/bot_handlers.py` via state `waiting_ai_query`.
- Voice/audio handoff (`ASR -> AI`) exists for AI mode.
- Metrics/telemetry for AI requests are not persisted in DB now.
- Conversation memory for direct AI mode is not persisted; prompts are single-turn (`create_prompt_with_language(..., context=None)`).
- Current direct prompt says "Ответь подробно", which conflicts with desired concise-first behavior.

## Existing Risk Signals from User Transcript
- Out-of-order/mixed replies likely from overlapping in-flight AI requests per user.
- Very long responses still possible semantically (even if chunking prevents Telegram hard error).
- Weak models drift without strict prompt contract + compact structured memory.

## Architecture Implications
- Instrumentation should be centralized in `AIProviderManager.query/query_multimodal` to cover all AI callers.
- Session memory should be a dedicated feature service, not ad-hoc `context.user_data`.
- Progress UX should be ephemeral Telegram message, deleted on completion, with >5s predictor trigger.
- Need per-user concurrency guard for AI requests to avoid stale/late answer interleaving.

## Scope Decision
This is a non-trivial cross-cutting feature touching:
- frontend AI mode UX/state,
- shared provider layer telemetry,
- DB schema + migrations,
- prompt policy and memory compression,
- tests/spec/docs.
